NOTE: difference between slice and splice methods

     --> slice() method gives us piece of array without changing
         the original one
     --> splice() method print piece of array but also modified 
         the original array.

EXAMPLE: array = [10,20,30,40,50]
         array.slice(1,4) --> [20,30,40]  ; 4th index doesnt include,also 
                                original array remains same

        array.splice(1,4) --> [20,30,40,50] ; 4th index includes but original
                             array will be --> [10]
